# The C Programming Language â€“ 2nd Edition: Solutions

ðŸ“˜ **About this Repository**  
This repository contains my **original solutions** to exercises and projects from the classic book  
*The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R).  

It serves as a **learning archive** for anyone studying C, with a focus on **clean, simple, and educational** code written from a beginner's perspective.

ðŸ“Œ **Repository Structure:**  
The repository is divided into chapters that mirror the structure of the book:  
- **ðŸ“‚ Chapter X:** Contains solutions to all exercises from that chapter.  
- Each file is named according to its exercise number, e.g., `exercise-01-03.c`.

**Status:**  
*This repository is a work in progress. Exercises are being added continuously as I go through the book.*

ðŸ“Œ **How to Use This Repository:**  
- All code is written in **standard C (ANSI C)** and can be compiled using any C compiler (like GCC):  
  ```sh
  gcc exercise-01-03.c -o exercise-01-03
  ./exercise-01-03
  ```
- These solutions are intended for **learning and self-study** purposes.  
- **The code will remain unchanged** as it documents my personal progress and reasoning while learning.

ðŸ“Œ **Feedback & Discussions:**  
- If you have suggestions or want to discuss alternative approaches, feel free to open an issue.
- However, **pull requests modifying the code will not be merged**, as this repository is meant to reflect my personal solutions.

ðŸ“Œ **License:**  
This repository is released under the **MIT License**. Feel free to reuse or modify the code with proper attribution.
